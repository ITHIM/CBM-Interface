## Welcome to the Impacts of Cycling Tool (ICT) Prototype

The ICT is designed to do two things

1. As a data visualisation tool to look at how people travel in England and how active they are
2. To look at how things would change under different scenarios in which the probability of being a cyclist increases


The starting point for the ICT is the National Travel Survey for England 2012. This allows us to look at how different groups in the population travel. To estimate physical activity we use both travel activity, and by combining the data with data on similar people from the Health Survey for England 2012, and non-travel physical activity.
The scenarios are based around:
  1. Assuming that non-cyclists start cycling for some of their trips 
  2. Assuming that people travel less far as land use patterns change and so are more likely to cycle

When modelling people becoming cyclists we run different sets of scenarios. 

The Cycling Multiplier is the increase in probability of being a cyclist.

In ‘equity’ scenarios we assume that men and women and older and younger people are equally likely to become cyclists. Without ‘equity’ we assume current inequalities remain.

If someone becomes a cyclist then that doesn’t mean they cycle all trips - people are more likely to cycle short trips than long ones. So we probabilistically model which of the trips are cycled based on the trip distances. Based on our data analysis, younger men are more likely to cycle farther than older men or women so we include this in our probabilistic model.

In ‘ebike’ scenarios we assume that new cyclists have got an ebike and so will be willing to cycle longer trips. We assume that with an ebike all population groups have the same probability of cycling different length trips.
The effects of people switching their trips to cycling are assessed across multiple domains including:
* health (physical activity levels, mortality rates)
* transport related CO2 emissions
* transport (trips time and mode shift)
* equity (uptake rate of cycling by women, elderly or ethnic minorities)

The impact on mortality risk of increasing activity is estimated based on this study <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2811%2960749-6/abstract" target="_blank">here</a>.
